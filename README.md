# Argus
Nix fake for a Raspberry Pi based IP-camera

## Goals
- Hardware: the project will be testing on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 1GB of RAM and the offical Rasbperry Pi camera module, but the setup should work for different Pi's and cameras
- The video stream should be optimized for [Frigate](https://frigate.video/)
- The flake should be "batteries include" but also allow from customization (hostname, IP address, etc.)

## Example Flake
```nix
# working on it..
```
